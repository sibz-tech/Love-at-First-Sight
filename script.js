    The sun has come.
    The mist has gone.
    We see in the distance... our long way home.
    I was always yours to have.
    You were always mine.
    We have loved each other in and out of time.

    When the first stone looked up at the blazing sun
    and the first tree struggled up from the forest floor
    I had always loved you more.
    You freed your braids...
    gave your hair to the breeze.
    It hummed like a hive of honey bees.
    I reached in the mass for the sweet honey comb there....
    Mmmm...God how I love your hair.

    You saw me bludgeoned by circumstance.
    Lost, injured, hurt by chance.
    I screamed to the heavens....loudly screamed....
    Trying to change our nightmares into dreams...
    The sun has come.
    The mist has gone.
    We see in the distance our long way home.

    I was always yours to have.
    You were always mine.
    We have loved each other in and out
    in and out
    in and out
    of time.`,

            message: `I know how quiet it can get when you miss someone. 
            It’s not just the silence — it’s the echo of all the things you want to say but don’t. 
            The memories play like soft reruns in the back of your mind — and I’m probably replaying them too, somewhere on my side of the sky.

            If you’re reading this, it means your chest feels just a little heavier than usual. So let me remind you: I’m not gone. Not in the ways that count. I’m in the songs you love, the places we laughed, the smell of that hoodie you borrowed but never gave back. I’m in the small things — the ones that stay even when people can’t.

            Sometimes missing someone isn’t about absence. It’s about how deep love runs — deeper than phone calls, closer than location. So if you're reaching for me right now, I want you to feel my hand stretching right back. No space is too wide. No silence too deep.

            Let this message be your proof:
            You are not alone in this missing.
            You are not forgotten in this distance.
            You are not unloved in this moment.

            When you miss me, love, I’m already halfway back to you.`,

But if I could, I’d wrap this entire day in softness — the kind that makes space for sadness without judgment.
      
            I know there are moments when even getting out of bed feels like a full-time job. When the world moves too fast, too loud, too demanding. And when that happens, I don’t need you to “fix” it. I don’t even need you to smile. I just want you to know: you can bring it all here. The messy, the tender, the heavy. I’ll hold it.
      
            Because love isn’t just for the shiny parts of you. It’s for the ache too. The grief. The confusion. The anger that has no name. And even when you don’t feel strong — I still see you standing.
      
            So rest here, even if only for a moment. Let this be your reminder that you don’t have to carry everything alone. I’m right here. Always.`,

            But baby, you don’t need to have it all figured out right now. You don’t need to solve the unsolvable or decode every feeling. Some things aren’t puzzles to be pieced together — they’re clouds that pass on their own when you stop gripping them so tightly.
     
            So breathe. Loosen your shoulders. Come back into your body. This moment doesn’t need your strategy, it just needs your presence. And maybe a hug. Or three.
     
            When your thoughts get too loud, let my love be the softer voice that reminds you: you are enough, even in the unfinished. You are safe, even in the unknown. You are loved, even in the overthinking.`,

            I don’t need you to be perfect. I don’t love you because you’re flawless — I love you because you’re you. Full stop. I chose you then, I choose you now, and I’ll keep choosing you in all the moments where you forget how lovable you are.
     
            Even when you're unsure, I'm not. Even when you're distant, my heart stays close. Even when your voice trembles, I hear you.

            Let the night carry you. Let the weight you’re holding fall away, even if just for a few hours. You are allowed to feel safe here. Nothing is chasing you. Nothing is being asked of you right now.

            Your beauty is not just in your looks. It’s in your laugh, your honesty, the way you care about things deeply. It’s in your flaws — the ones you think make you unlovable. They don’t. They make you human. And I didn’t fall for an illusion. I fell for you.
     
            I know sometimes you compare yourself, second-guess everything, and replay the worst parts louder than the best. But I see the whole picture. And it’s breathtaking.
     
            So next time the insecurity creeps in and tries to lie to you, come back here and remember:
     
            You are already more than enough.
