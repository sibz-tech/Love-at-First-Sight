# 💌 Love @ First Sight

[**View Live Project Here**](https://sibz-tech.github.io/Love-at-First-Sight/)

**Love @ First Sight** is an interactive, folder-style web experience designed as a gift of words, comfort, and presence. Each section (or “pocket”) holds a message, a quote, and a themed reflection. The app moves like a book but flows digitally, creating a smooth, private, and immersive journey.

## ✨ What to Expect

When you open the app, you’ll move seamlessly between pages:

1. **Front Cover** – The opening screen, setting the tone for the experience.
2. **Copyright Page** – Protecting the creative work and its intention.
3. **Dedication Page** – Featuring *In and Out of Time* by Maya Angelou.
4. **Table of Contents** – A list of all nine “pockets” to explore.
5. **Folder Front Page** – Each folder has a title, a short note, and a symbolic “song from my heart.”
6. **Inside the Folder** – The full message, broken into:

   * **Title** (e.g., *When You Miss Me*)
   * **From Me to You** (the message itself)
   * **Quote** (the final thought)
     Navigation buttons allow you to return to the Table of Contents or the Home (front cover).
